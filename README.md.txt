# Day Planner

## Description

This application is designed to help the user plan out their 9 to 5 work day schedule.

I used moment.js to display the current date and time (including seconds and am/pm).

The user will be able to enter their plans/tasks for each hour timeblock, and save their input to localStorage.

(Currently, the input saves to localStorage, but is cleared from the page upon refresh. I'm working to fix this)

## Usage

Using this application is extremely straightforward.

Simply fill out the timeblocks with your relevant tasks for the day, and click the save button next to the appropriate 
timeblock to save your input.

You will notice that when you reach the time of day associated with a timeblock (ex: once it becomes 10 am, the 10 am 
timeblock will turn red, to remind you to tend to your tasks in that timeblock.

As well, if a timeblock is in the past, it will then turn grey to indicate that.

For all other timeblocks that are in the future, they will be displayed as green, to indicate that they have not 
happened yet.
